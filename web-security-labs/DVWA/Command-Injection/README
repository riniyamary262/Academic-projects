# 🎯 DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) Labs

## 📋 Overview
DVWA is a PHP/MySQL web application that is damn vulnerable for security learning purposes. It demonstrates common web vulnerabilities with different security levels.

## 🔐 Security Levels Tested
- **Low:** No security mechanisms
- **Medium:** Basic protection (easily bypassed)
- **High:** Better protection (harder to bypass)
- **Impossible:** Secure code (reference implementation)

## 📁 Labs Covered
1. **Command Injection** - OS command execution via input fields
2. **SQL Injection** - Database manipulation through SQL queries
3. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** - Client-side code injection
4. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** - Unauthorized action execution
5. **File Inclusion** - Local and remote file inclusion attacks
